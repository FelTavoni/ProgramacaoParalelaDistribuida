# FDM in Heat Equation

> This repository implements a parallelized version of the FDM in Heat Equation proposed in the 14th Marathon of Parallel Programming presented by Universidade Mackenzie. More details about the code to be added...


### ‚öôÔ∏è Adjustments and improvements

This project still under development and the next updates will be aiming the following tasks:

- [ ] Allocation problems (Trying to linearize the matrix);
- [ ] A more detailed explanation of the CUDA code on READMe.

## üíª Prerequisites

Before you start, check if you have matched the following requisites:
* Instal the following tools and their versions `< C \ CUDA >`.
* Windows as OS.
